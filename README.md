### 👋 Hi, I’m **Lukas**. I'm a student in IT and have about 9 years of experience in development and design (or 5 years of *"real"* programming).
- 🗿 A very active developer, even if not on GitHub, I am working on something basically 99% of my free time.
- 👀 I’m interested in **development, design, art, sound design and composition, game development, hardware systems and networking, and science**, and i'm working on creating my own open ecosystem. I support **FOSS** and like to create my own libraries and tools.
- 🌱 Learning new stuff everyday.
- 💞️ I love to help beginner developers get started.

## Languages

My top languages are C++ and JavaScript.

JavaScript is the language I have the most experience with - written hundreds of thousands of lines, spent countless hours optimizing and rewriting code.

| Language                     | Opinion      | Experience   |
|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Glitter | 🫥 *will* surely be great | ∞ I made it |
| Intersion | Interdimensional travelling | ∞ I made it |
| JavaScript | 💖 Love It | ~5 years, mastered |
| Assembly | 💪 Best | very small but some (ARM, x86_64) |
| C++ | 🟢 Amazing | ~3 years |
| Shell script | 🟢 Cool | sure |
| PHP | 🟡 Decent ig, not very useful today | ~7 years, replaced by JS |
| Python | 🟠 Only for prototypes | I don't use it |
| TypeScript | 😕 Eh, I guess. | small |
| C# | 😕 Just Java from Microsoft | small |
| Java | ❌ Nope. | ~4 regretable years.. people still use this? |
| Rust | 🫥 Excited to try | not yet, so far found no good thing to use it for |

## Operating Systems

I'm a Linux user, my daily driver being Fedora with the Cinnamon desktop.<br>
My first desktop OS was Vista, but I have also daily-driven Windows XP, and I love exploring all kinds of operating systems.<br>
My first daily-driver Linux distro was Ubuntu (shocking).

| OS                     | Opinion      | Experience   |
|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Fedora Linux | 💖 Love It, clean, modern, just works | Daily driver |
| GNU+Linux | 💖 Love It | |
| Debian-based (Ubuntu etc.) | 🟡 Meh. Messy and fragile, everything takes 2x the effort | ~6 years+ light use |
| LiOS | 🫥 i'm sure it will be awesome | We made it, sort of |
| Android | 😥 Ruined by corporates | Daily driver |
| iOS | 👎 Not for me | Most newer versions (12-26), but I couldn't get myself to daily drive it, it's like a dumb phone compared to Android |
| Symbian | 🟡 Decent, rest in peace lol | At least 4 years, S60 and Belle as well |
| TempleOS | ✝️ As god intended | Tried it |
| KolibriOS | 💾 How is it 1.4MB | Tried it |
| MacOS | 😕 If you just browse the web and send mails | Technically from IIGS to latest |
| ChromeOS | 😕 It serves its purpose i guess | Very small |
| FreeBSD | 🟡 Not enough experience to make an opinion | Tried it |
| Solaris | 🟡 Not enough experience to make an opinion | Tried it |
| Windows Phone | 🟡 Why tho | v6.5, v8.1, v10 (daily-drived it once - its ok, but just inconvenient) |
| Windows | ❌ Bloated, slow, hostile to developers | Used since Vista, later tried basically every known version |
