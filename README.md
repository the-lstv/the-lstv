### 👋 Hi, I’m **Lukas**. I'm a student in IT and have about 9 years of experience in development and design (or 5 years of *"real"* programming).
- 🗿 A very active developer, even if not on GitHub, I am working on something basically 99% of my free time.
- 👀 I’m interested in **development, design, hardware systems and networking**, and i'm working on creating my own open ecosystem. I support **FOSS** and like to create my own libraries and tools.
- 🌱 Learning new stuff everyday.
- 💞️ I love to help beginner developers get started.
- 📫 Best way to reach me is via Discord: **@thelstv**<br>

## Languages

My top languages are C++ and JavaScript.

JavaScript is the language I have the most experience with - having written hundereds of thousands of lines, spent countless hours optimizing and rewriting code, I've gotten a pretty decent understanding on the language's inner workings and how to write efficient and responsive code.
C++ is also a language I enjoy using, though have considerably less experience with compared to JS.

I am also sometimes considering making my own programming language, called "Glitter", and actually already written about ~4-ish parsers and incomplete compilers. So far I've abandoned the idea pretty quickly when I considered the amount of required effort for something that won't be the C++ killer anyways.

| Language                     | Opinion      | Experience   |
|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Glitter | 🫥 *will* surely be great | ∞ I made it |
| Intersion | Interdimensional travelling | ∞ I made it |
| JavaScript | 💖 Love It | ~5 years, mastered |
| Assembly | 💪 Objectively the best | very small but some (ARM, x86_64) |
| C++ | 🟢 Bloated but amazing | ~3 years |
| Shell script | 🟢 Cool | sure |
| PHP | 🟡 Decent ig, not very useful today | ~7 years, replaced by JS |
| Python | 🟠 Only for prototypes | I don't use it |
| TypeScript | 😕 Eh, I guess. Can be useful, not a replacement | small |
| C# | 😕 Just Java from Microsoft | small |
| Java | ❌ Nope. | ~4 regretable years |
| Rust | 🫥 Mixed feelings, excited to try | not yet, but I definitely plan to use it in the future |

## Operating Systems

I'm a Linux user, my daily driver being Fedora with the Cinnamon desktop.<br>
My first Windows was Vista, but I have unironically also daily-driven Windows XP, and I really love exploring all kinds of operating systems, so I've tested a good amount of them over the years.<br>
My first daily-driver Linux distro was Ubuntu (shocking right), then Linux Mint, and then finally Fedora which I fell in love with instantly and now I use it everywhere.

| OS                     | Opinion      | Experience   |
|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Fedora Linux | 💖 Love It | Daily driver |
| GNU+Linux | 💖 Love It | |
| RHEL based | 💖 Fast, modern, clean, and just works | |
| Debian based | 🟡 Meh. Messy and fragile, everything takes 2x the effort | ~6 years+ light use |
| LiOS | 🫥 i'm sure it will be awesome | We made it, sort of |
| Android | 😥 Ruined by stupid policies, like let me use my dang device | Daily driver |
| iOS | 👎 Definitely not for me | Most newer versions (12-18), but I couldn't get myself to actually daily drive it, it feels like a dumb phone compared to Android |
| Symbian | 🟡 Decent, rest in peace | At least 4 years, S60 and Belle as well |
| KolibriOS | 💾 How is it 1.4MB | Tried it |
| TempleOS | ✝️ Third Temple | Tried it |
| MacOS | 😕 If you just browse the web and send mails, its useable | Technically since IIGS |
| ChromeOS | 😕 It serves its purpose i guess | Very small |
| Windows Phone | 🟡 Why | v6.5, v8.1, v10 (daily-drived it once) |
| Windows | ❌ Bloated and slow, hostile to developers | Using since Vista, later also tried every known version |
