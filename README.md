### 👋 Hi, I’m **Lukas**. I'm a student in IT and have about 9 years of experience in development and design (or 5 years of *"real"* programming).
- 🗿 A very active developer, even if not on GitHub, I am working on something basically 99% of my free time.
- 👀 I’m interested in **development, design, hardware systems and networking**, and i'm working on creating my own open ecosystem. I support **FOSS** and like to create my own libraries and tools.
- 🌱 Learning new stuff everyday.
- 💞️ I love to help beginner developers get started.
- 📫 Best way to reach me is via Discord: **@thelstv**<br>
      My website: https://lstv.space, i'm also the sysadmin of https://extragon.cloud<br>
